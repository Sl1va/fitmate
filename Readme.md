Any accessible product have barcode, which is unique to the product that it represents. Users should be just scan and get their needs. However, there are issues to deal with data(i.e. adding, removing, updating ingredients) that take a lot of time. The ways to handle these issues are listed below.
1) Specifically devoted to an organiztation that ensures is product halal. It includes accounts for members of that organization and users (or consumers).
2) The project is free from any third party that checks is product halal. However, developers, on their own, will determine the product based on ingredients(adding them, collecting database, always in-check).
